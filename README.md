# Netflix Signup UI (HTML & CSS)

A static replica of the Netflix signup interface built with HTML and CSS.

## Overview
- A small frontend exercise that reproduces a Netflix-like signup screen.
- Includes a centered signup form over a full-bleed background image.

## Features
- Form fields: `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Email address`, `Password`, `Confirm Password`.
- Terms checkbox and links for `Terms of Use` / `Privacy Policy`.
- Primary action: `Create Account` button; links for `Sign In` and `Contact Support`.
- Styled with external `style.css` (background image, translucent form panel, responsive centering).

## Files
- `index.html` — markup for the signup page.
- `style.css` — styles for layout, colors, and responsive behavior.
- `images/` — image assets used by the page (if present).

## How to view
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Or use a local dev server (for example, the `Live Server` extension in VS Code).

## Notes
- Styles were moved from inline to the external `style.css` file.
- This is a static UI only — there is no backend or form validation implemented.

Created as a practice project to learn CSS layout, positioning, and simple UI composition.
